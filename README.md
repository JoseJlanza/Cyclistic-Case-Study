Analyzing bike-share data to understand member vs. casual rider behavior and drive membership growth.

📌 Overview
This project analyzes Cyclistic bike-share data to explore the differences between annual members and casual riders. The goal is to provide data-driven insights and recommendations to increase membership conversions.

Data Source: Cyclistic trip data (last 12 months)
